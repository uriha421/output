# Title (you can use # once only.)
## Introduction (you can use ## once only.)
At introduction, you need write what you readers already know, understand or agree.
You need to make sure that the readers and you are on the same stage.
Then you need to write a question or problem on the situation. Finally write some points to support your argument.

* The first point.
* The second point.
* The third point.

### The first point
As you can see, you have item numbers automatically.
This is a sample code below.

``` go
func getTrue() bool {
    return true
}
```
